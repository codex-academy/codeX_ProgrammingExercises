##Background

Write a simple game where a player needs to enter their name and a skill level easy/intermediate/advanced.

The game should generate a random number. The player of the game should guess the number generated. 

If the guess is too high it should tell the user the it’s guess is too high or low. 

For example:

 * Sorry <user_name> your guess is to low Or Sorry <user_name> your guess is too high 

If the guess is correct display : 

 * Well done, <user_name> the number is <the number>, it took you <number of guesses> guesses”.

If the user selected easy:

 * the max number for the random number seed is 50, if intermediate it is 250 and if hard it should be 1000.

Bonus features: 
  * Let the  game remember the three best attempts. 
  * Congratulate the user if he is in the top 3.
