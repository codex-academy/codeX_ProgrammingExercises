# Given a list of numbers separated with spaces. 

* Find the biggest number
* Find the smallest number
* What is the average of all the numbers
* Find all even numbers
* Find all uneven numbers
* Find all prime numbers

Do this using TDD using QUnit.

## Create 3 files:
	* test-number-utility.html 
	* test-number-utility.js : write your tests in here
	* number-utility.js : write your number utility in here

## Something more to think about: 
How would you create a little web application for this?
	As before we will get to this later.
